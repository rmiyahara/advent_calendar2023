# Advent Calendar 2023
A friend told me to try this out. Here are my results. I can't guarantee I'll finish everything, but its been fun so far!

## Why Python?
I did this in Python because Bradley said "You won't". So I did.

## How To Run
Make sure you have Python 3 installed which can installed with this:
`
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
`
Each subdirectory is set up to run the final part of the problem set. I will try to keep all solution logic intact for archiving.

The files themselves are set up to be run from the root. For example:
`
python day1/day1.py
`
